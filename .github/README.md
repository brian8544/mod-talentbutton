# TalentButton Module

The `mod-talentbutton` module for AzerothCore enhances the player experience by allowing characters to learn Dual Talent Specialization at level 10 and adds a convenient button to unlearn talents from anywhere in the world. This eliminates the need for players to visit a class trainer to reset their talents, providing a seamless and flexible way to experiment with different talent builds.

## Requirements
- An **unpatched World of Warcraft 3.3.5 client**. RCE-Patched clients using tools like [RCEPatcher](https://github.com/stoneharry/RCEPatcher) will prevent the script injection from working.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository into your AzerothCore `modules` directory
2. Re-run CMake and rebuild your AzerothCore server to include the `mod-talentbutton` module.
3. Copy the `mod_talentbutton.conf.dist` file to your server's configuration directory.
